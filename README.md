This package is base on [manage-minor-mode](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/manage-minor-mode),
but it uses `tabulated-list` instead of the dedicated interface buffer. 
There are not much differences between the two packages, IMO this 
is a better way to manage `minor-mode`s.

## Usage

Call `manage-minor-mode-table` function/command like this.

```
M-x manage-minor-mode-table
```
